## Desciption
* Room is a persistent library in Android that allows fluent access to the database by creating an abstract layer over SQLite. It simplifies the process of adding a structured SQL database to your app. 
* The app allows to enter items in the grocery list, which takes in three variables - Item Name, Item Rate, and Item Quantity
* In case the values for mentioned variables are not entered, the app shows a toast asking for entering the values.
* In addition to these, user can also delete grocery items from the list
